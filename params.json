You can add a custom view, representing your custom content, and add any number of buttons to represent actions related to that content. You can also forgo any custom view and simply present a number of actionable buttons.\r\n\r\n![Picker View](https://sintraworks.github.io/ActionSheetController/Images/ActionSheetContollerSample1.png)\r\n![Buttons, light theme](https://sintraworks.github.io/ActionSheetController/Images/ActionSheetContollerSample2.png)\r\n\r\n![Buttons, dark theme](https://sintraworks.github.io/ActionSheetController/Images/ActionSheetContollerSample3.png)\r\n\r\nAcionSheetController is written in **Swift** and was inspired by [RMActionController](https://github.com/CooperRS/RMActionController) by [Roland Moers](https://github.com/CooperRS). AcionSheetController differs in a number of aspects, firstly, of course, by being written in Swift, and also importantly by basing itself on **UIStackView**.\r\nUsage\r\n====\r\nBy default ActionSheetController doesn't contain a content view, and will only show buttons for any actions you add. To show a content view you simply set the contentView property to hold the desired view. There is generally no need to subclass ActionSheetController, although you can if you want to.\r\n\r\n###Adding a view\r\nLets say you want to add a date picker:\r\n- You instantiate a UIDatePicker\r\n- You instantiate an action and consult the date picker in its handler, to extract the selected date.\r\n- You set the picker as the content view of the ActionSheetController\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nprivate func datePickerSheet() -> ActionSheetController {\r\n        let pickerView = UIDatePicker(frame: CGRectZero)\r\n\r\n        let okAction = ActionSheetControllerAction(style: .Done, title: \"OK\", dismissesActionController: true) { controller in\r\n            let date = pickerView.date\r\n            let action = AlertAction(title: \"Hurray!\", style: .Default, enabled: true, isPreferredAction: true) {\r\n                print(\"Dismissed!\")\r\n            }\r\n            let alertInfo = AlertInfo(title: \"Success\", message: \"You picked date: \\(date.description)\", actions: [action])\r\n            AlertPresenter.sharedAlertPresenter.addAlert(alertInfo)\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        let cancelAction = ActionSheetControllerAction(style: .Cancel, title: \"Cancel\", dismissesActionController: true, handler: nil)\r\n        let sheetController = ActionSheetController(title: \"Date Picker\", message: \"Pick a date for your enjoymentâ€¦\", cancelAction: cancelAction, okAction: okAction)\r\n        \r\n        sheetController.contentView = pickerView\r\n        \r\n        return sheetController\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n###Presenting\r\nPresenting the controller is pretty standard:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n        var sheetController = self.datePickerSheet()\r\n        self.controller.presentViewController(sheetController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Presentation Style\r\nActionSheetController can be presented as a popover on iPad, and it has a light and a dark theme, suitable for different context, and/or personal preference.\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n\r\n| Compile Time  | Runtime       |\r\n| :------------ | :------------ |\r\n| Xcode 7       | iOS 9         |\r\n| iOS 9 SDK     |               \r\n\r\n## License (MIT License)\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Antonio Nunes\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
